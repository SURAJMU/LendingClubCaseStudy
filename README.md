# Lending Club Case Study
> Solving this assignment will give us an idea about how real business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, apart from applying the EDA techniques, we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## General Information
- You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
  Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
    1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
    2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- Using the data given which is about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
- Company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- Dataset that is being used here is the loan.csv - It contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.
